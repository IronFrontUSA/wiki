## TRAINING OUTLINE
* Purpose & Introduction
* OPSEC Defined
* Critical Information
* Threats
* Indicators
* Vulnerabilities
* OPSEC Measures
* Summary
* OPSEC Points of Contact

---
## OPSEC Defined
### OPSEC:
An analytic process by which an organization can deny potential
adversaries information about capabilities and intentions by identifying,
controlling, and protecting evidence of the planning and execution of
sensitive activities and operations.

### What Does That Mean To Us?
Practicing OPSEC means protecting information that is sensitive or
critical, information that someone could use to:
* Hurt/kill members or their families
* Disrupt missions, exercises and day-to-day activities
* Reduce overall chapter strength and effectiveness
* Profit at the expense of the organization or individual persons

---
## PROCESS
### The 5-Step OPSEC Process:
* Identify Critical Information
* Analyze the Threat
* Analyze Vulnerabilities
* Assess Risk
* Apply OPSEC Measures

### What Role Do We Play In OPSEC?
**Everyone:** Members, Admins and Guests must
know and understand their chapter’s OPSEC plan.

### What information needs to be protected?
* How adversaries are trying to collect it
* What measures we must follow to ensure information is protected at our
unit

### Critical Information
* Information adversaries, or potential adversaries,
need to prevent our success.
* Information we must protect to ensure success.
* Sensitive, but not secret.

### Critical Information Examples
* Personally Identifiable Information (PII): SSNs, home phone numbers,
addresses, etc.
* Locations of events or exercises
* Specific details about events (exact locations, equipment, training plans,
personnel involved, etc.)
* Physical security plans
* Group movement plans or itineraries
* Rules of engagement
* Computer network security details (policies, hardware, security software, etc.)
* Group morale

---
## Critical Information List
**(CIL)**
* List of the types of critical information a
Chapter Liaison has identified that require
safeguarding
* Declarative (statement)

---
## Essential Elements of Friendly Information (EEFI)
* Questions an adversary would want to have answered in order to
affect our operations, also identified by the Chapter Liaisons
* Interrogative (question)
* Least preferred method of identifying critical information than the CIL

---
## Distinguishing Critical Information
**Specific information we want to
protect:** Names of members, or
addresses.

**As a CIL Item:** The locations of
meetings or gatherings.

**As an EEFI Item:** What are the
locations of meetings or gatherings?

---
## Critical Information List:
* AIF Chapter Liaison or Admin travel
schedules and itineraries
* AIF Chapter Liaison or Admin PII
* Types and quantities of PPE/weapons/ammunition stored or carried.
* Security measures used to protect members.
* Specific capabilities, value, limitations, and vulnerabilities of
organization and equipment.
* Rules of engagement for current or future events.
* Identification of Mission Essential Vulnerable Areas (MEVAs) and the
specific reasons for this designation. (Example: the location where
members personal vehicles are parked.)
* Diagrams and information identifying the numbers and locations of
members, communication nodes.

---
## Threats to Critical Information
### Threat:
the likeliness a potential adversary
possesses the capability and intent to
collect our critical information.
### Potential Adversaries:
* Enemies (Proud Boys, Oath Keepers,
Neo-Nazi groups)
* Foreign Allies
* Frauds & Insiders
* Political Demonstrators

---
## Agendas Are Wide and Diverse
### Enemies
* Kill or otherwise harm members or
members families
### Foreign Allies
* Intelligence collection
* Technology collection
### Frauds & Insiders
* Determine ways to exploit the
Group or members for financial
gain
* Steal personal information for
fraudulent use

---
## Indicators
Friendly detectable actions or open-source information that can be
interpreted or pieced together by an adversary to derive
intelligence.

---
## Indicators
* Increase (or
decrease) in
activity
* Sudden
changes in
procedures
* Staging of
cargo or
vehicles
* Presence of
specialized
equipment
* Increased
security
measures

---
## Vulnerability
A condition in which friendly actions provide OPSEC indicators that may be obtained and by an adversary
in time to provide a basis for effective adversary decisions.
***In other words:*** Friendly actions that allow an adversary to gather intelligence to plan or act against
members.

---
## Common Vulnerabilities
*  Discussion of sensitive information in
unsecured areas.
* Lack of policy / enforcement
  * Cameras
  * Cell phones
  * Internet Usage
  * Shredding / deleting
* Lack of Training
* Data Aggregation

---
## OPSEC Measures
* Policies, procedures or actions taken to reduce or eliminate the risk of critical information becoming
available to potential adversaries.
* Based off an assessment of the risk that the vulnerabilities identified can be exploited.
* These are the SOPs, policies, etc. we all must follow in our day-to-day activities in order to safeguard our
organization’s critical information.

---
## OPSEC Measures
1. Avoid open posting
of planning
schedules which
reveal when
sensitive events
will occur.
1. Control the
movement of
groups, programs,
etc., or key
personnel.
1. Control trash and
housekeeping
functions to
conceal sensitive
activities.

---
## OPSEC Measures
1. Ensure that discussions or releases to the media receive an
OPSEC review.
1. Control access to discord and element and vet those personnel not
assigned.
1. Be prepared to sanitize personal electronic devices of sensitive
information on short notice.

---
## OPSEC Measures
1. Make maximum use of secure
communications.
1. Digitally encrypt chats when
appropriate.

---
## OPSEC Measures
### Limit
Limit release of information until
latest possible date or until
activities are complete.
### Safeguard
Safeguard any reports on group personnel.
Limit Limit distribution to personnel with need to know.
### Minimal
Minimal distribution on rosters which identify members by position, name, online handle, or other
PII.
### Inform
Inform all members that we could unwittingly magnify adversarial capabilities simply by
exchanging photos with friends, relatives, or by publishing them on the internet or other media.

---
## Summary
* OPSEC is a process by which an organization identifies, controls and protects critical information.
* Potential adversaries come in many forms; not all of them want to kill or destroy.
* It is the responsibility of everyone in the group to be familiar with the CIL and comply with the
organization’s OPSEC plan.
Summary
* By knowing the plan and CIL, you are hiding indicators and reducing vulnerabilities an adversary could
exploit.
* If you have any questions on OPSEC or suspect an OPSEC violation, contact your OPSEC officer
immediately.
